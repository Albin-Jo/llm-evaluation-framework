    "context": "For international business travel, employees must ensure they have a valid passport with at least six months validity beyond their return date. Visa requirements should be checked well in advance, and the company's contracted visa service (Global Visa Services at 1-866-555-8765) can assist with applications. Employees traveling internationally must register their trip with the Global Security department at least 7 days before departure by emailing security@company.com with their itinerary. The company provides international health insurance coverage through Global Health Partners; employees should carry their insurance card and download the assistance app. Employees should also enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) with the U.S. State Department if they are U.S. citizens. For health and safety, travelers should consult with their healthcare provider about required vaccinations at least 8 weeks before departure and can expense these costs. The company recommends using the corporate credit card for all international expenses to avoid foreign transaction fees. Per diem rates for international locations vary by country and can be found in the International Travel Guidelines document. Employees should be aware of cultural norms and business practices of their destination and can request a cultural briefing from the Global Mobility team.",

    "context": "Employees may rent cars for business travel when other transportation options are not practical or cost-effective. Rentals should be booked through the TravelPro platform to ensure corporate rates and insurance coverage. The company has preferred agreements with Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis. Employees should select intermediate/mid-size vehicles unless transporting multiple colleagues or equipment that requires a larger vehicle. Luxury vehicles are not permitted without explicit VP approval. The company's insurance policy covers physical damage to rental vehicles when they are booked through the TravelPro system, so employees should decline the rental company's Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) and Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) in locations where our coverage applies (see the International Exceptions list for countries where local coverage should be purchased). However, liability insurance should be accepted where required by law. Fuel should be refilled before returning the vehicle to avoid excessive refueling charges. Rental cars should only be used for business purposes; personal use may result in the employee being responsible for a portion of the rental cost. Employees must have a valid driver's license and a good driving record to rent vehicles for business purposes. Any accidents must be reported immediately to the rental company, local authorities (if required), and the company's Risk Management department at risk@company.com.",

    "query": "What should I do if my business trip gets canceled?",
    "context": "If a business trip is canceled, employees should take immediate steps to minimize costs and follow proper notification procedures. First, cancel all reservations through the TravelPro system as soon as possible. Many airlines, hotels, and car rental companies offer full refunds if cancellations are made within 24-48 hours of booking or more than 72 hours before the scheduled service. If you've made reservations by phone or outside the TravelPro system, contact the vendor directly to cancel. Notify your manager and any clients or colleagues you were scheduled to meet. For airline tickets that cannot be refunded, the value can typically be applied to future business travel within one year, minus a change fee. Document the credit in the TravelPro system under your profile in the 'Travel Credits' section. If you received a travel advance, it must be returned to Finance within 5 business days of trip cancellation; complete the Travel Advance Return Form and submit it with your repayment. If you incurred any non-refundable expenses, you may submit an expense report for these items, clearly noting that they were for a canceled trip and providing the reason for cancellation and documentation of the non-refundable nature of the expense. The Travel Desk can assist with complex cancellations or when significant costs are involved; contact them at travel@company.com or ext. 5555.",

    "query": "What are the rules for traveling with coworkers?",
    "context": "When traveling with coworkers, several guidelines apply to ensure safety, compliance with company policies, and appropriate use of resources. For air travel, no more than 25% of any department's employees should be on the same flight to minimize business disruption in case of delays or emergencies. Similarly, executives from the C-suite should not travel on the same flight. For ground transportation, employees are encouraged to share rental cars or taxis/rideshares when traveling to the same destination to reduce costs. When dining with colleagues during business travel, one person (typically the most senior employee present) should pay for the entire group and submit for reimbursement, clearly listing all attendees on the expense report. The per diem meal allowance applies to each individual. Reasonable business entertainment with colleagues is permitted during travel, such as team dinners, but must comply with the standard Entertainment Policy guidelines. When booking hotels, employees should have individual rooms unless there's a significant business reason (such as conference space shortage) that requires room sharing, which must be approved by a VP. All regular business travel policies regarding expense limits, booking procedures, and prohibited expenses apply when traveling with colleagues. Team-building activities during business travel must be pre-approved and have a clear business purpose. Any concerns about inappropriate behavior during business travel should be reported according to the company's Code of Conduct procedures.",

    "query": "What is the policy on extending business trips for personal travel?",
    "context": "Employees may extend business trips for personal travel under certain conditions. The primary purpose of the trip must be for legitimate business reasons, and the personal component should be secondary. Any additional costs resulting from the personal extension are the responsibility of the employee. This includes extra hotel nights, meals, transportation, and any difference in airfare if the departure or return dates change. If airfare increases due to the personal extension, the employee must pay the difference. Conversely, if extending the trip reduces the airfare (e.g., staying over a Saturday night), the company will cover the lower fare amount. Personal extensions should generally not exceed the business portion of the trip without prior approval from the employee's manager. Employees must use personal time (vacation or PTO) for the non-business days of extended trips. Travel insurance does not cover injuries or incidents that occur during the personal portion of the trip. Employees should book the business portion through the TravelPro system and handle personal arrangements separately when possible. For complex itineraries, employees should contact the Travel Desk for assistance in determining the appropriate cost allocation. Employees on international assignments with tax equalization should consult with Global Mobility before adding personal travel, as there may be tax implications. All extended trips must be approved in advance by the employee's manager, regardless of whether there is a cost impact.",

    "query": "How much can I spend on meals during business travel?",
    "context": "For meal expenses during business travel, the company maintains a per diem system with specific limits based on location. For domestic travel within the United States, employees may expense up to $75 per day for meals and incidental expenses, allocated as follows: $15 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, and $40 for dinner. If a meal is provided by the company, included in a conference registration, or otherwise paid for, that meal allowance should be deducted from the daily total. For international locations, meal allowances vary by country and city based on local costs, with details available in the International Per Diem Table on the Finance portal. High-cost cities like London, Tokyo, and Zurich have higher allowances than standard locations. Itemized receipts are required for individual meal expenses exceeding $25. Alcohol is only reimbursable during business meals with clients or colleagues, with a limit of 2 drinks per person. The cost of alcohol should be included within the meal limits, not in addition to them. Room service meals are reimbursable but subject to the same daily limits. Employees are not required to submit receipts for meals under the per diem limits but should track their daily spending to ensure compliance. Expenses exceeding the per diem limits require a business justification and manager approval. Tips of up to 20% on meals are considered part of the meal expense and included in the per diem limits.",

    "context": "Employees may use rideshare services such as Uber, Lyft, and similar platforms for business transportation when traveling. These services are often more cost-effective than traditional taxis or car services, especially in major metropolitan areas. Employees should select standard ride options (e.g., UberX, Lyft Standard) rather than premium services (e.g., Uber Black, Lyft Lux) unless there's a specific business need or safety concern. Shared rides (e.g., UberPool, Lyft Shared) are permitted but not required if employees prefer private transportation. For safety and expense tracking, employees should use their company email when setting up rideshare accounts for business travel and enable electronic receipts. All rideshare expenses must be submitted with receipts that show the date, time, pickup and drop-off locations, and total cost. Tips of up to 20% are reimbursable for rideshare services. Employees can use the company's business account with Uber for Business if their department has enrolled; this allows direct billing to the company and simplifies expense reporting. When traveling to and from airports, employees should compare costs between rideshare services, airport shuttles, and public transportation, selecting the most economical option that is practical given time constraints and luggage. During surge pricing periods, employees should consider alternatives if the surge multiplier exceeds 2.0x the standard rate, or document the business necessity for paying the higher rate. Personal detours during business rideshare trips should be paid for separately by the employee.",

For international flights with a flight time exceeding 8 hours, employees at Director level and above may book business class. For flights under 8 hours, all employees are expected to travel in economy class, though they may use personal frequent flyer miles to upgrade if desired. Employees below Director level may be authorized to travel business class on international flights over 8 hours if they are traveling with clients who are in business class, if they have a documented medical need (requires HR approval), or if they are expected to attend a critical business meeting within 4 hours of landing. Any exceptions to these guidelines require approval from a VP or above. When booking business class travel, employees should still seek the lowest logical fare and book at least 21 days in advance when possible. If business class is authorized but the employee chooses to book economy, they may not use the fare difference for other travel costs or as a form of compensation. The Travel Desk monitors compliance with this policy, and violations may require reimbursement from the employee and/or disciplinary action.

    "query": "How do I submit expenses after a business trip?",
    "context": "After completing a business trip, employees must submit their expenses within 14 calendar days through the company's Expense Management System (EMS), accessible via the Finance portal. Begin by creating a new expense report, selecting 'Business Travel' as the report type, and entering the trip purpose, dates, and destination. All expenses must be itemized by date and category (e.g., airfare, hotel, meals, ground transportation). Attach electronic copies of itemized receipts for all expenses over $25; receipt images can be uploaded directly through the EMS mobile app. Hotel bills must be itemized to separate lodging, meals, internet, and other charges. Meals should be categorized as breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and must not exceed the daily per diem limits. Any attendees at business meals must be listed with their names and companies. Expenses in foreign currencies will be automatically converted by the EMS using the exchange rate for the transaction date, but employees should verify the conversion is accurate. If a corporate credit card was used, import those transactions directly from the card feed in EMS and match them to the appropriate expense categories. For any unusual expenses or those requiring special approval, include explanatory notes in the comments field. Once the report is complete, submit it through the system, which will route it to the appropriate manager for approval. After manager approval, expense reports are processed by Accounts Payable, and reimbursements are typically issued within 5-7 business days via direct deposit. Any expenses submitted more than 60 days after they were incurred may be considered taxable income per IRS regulations.",
