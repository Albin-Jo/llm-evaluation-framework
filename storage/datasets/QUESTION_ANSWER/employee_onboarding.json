These objectives are documented in the Performance Management System (PMS). Throughout the year, you'll have quarterly check-ins with your manager to discuss progress, address challenges, and adjust goals if necessary.

    "query": "What is the process for expense reimbursement?",
    "context": "The company's expense reimbursement process allows employees to be reimbursed for approved business expenses. All business expenses must be pre-approved by your manager when possible, and must comply with the company's Travel and Expense Policy found on the Finance portal. Employees should use their company-issued credit card for all business expenses when possible. Personal credit cards should only be used when the company card is not accepted or for small expenses when the company card is not available. To submit expenses for reimbursement, log into the Expense Management System (EMS) at expenses.company.com using your network credentials. Create a new expense report, selecting the appropriate report type (Travel, Office Supplies, Client Entertainment, etc.). For each expense, you must include the date, amount, merchant name, business purpose, and appropriate expense category and cost center. Itemized receipts are required for all expenses over $25 and should be attached electronically to each line item. For meals with clients or colleagues, you must list all attendees and the business purpose of the meeting. For mileage reimbursement, you must include the starting and ending locations, the total miles traveled, and the business purpose. The current mileage reimbursement rate is $0.625 per mile. Once your expense report is complete, submit it through the system for approval. Your direct manager will receive an email notification to review and approve your submission. For expenses over $500, additional approval from a Director or VP may be required based on your department's approval matrix. After all approvals are received, the Finance department processes reimbursements within 5-7 business days. Reimbursements are typically included in your next paycheck, unless you've set up direct deposit for expense reimbursements separately. All expenses must be submitted within 30 days of being incurred. Expenses submitted after 60 days require VP approval and may be considered taxable income per IRS regulations. For questions about expense reimbursement, contact the Accounts Payable team at ap@company.com or extension 2345.",

    "query": "What are the company's communication tools and how do I use them?",
    "context": "The company provides several communication tools to facilitate effective collaboration. Microsoft Outlook is the primary email platform, accessible via the desktop application on your company laptop or through the web at mail.company.com. Your email address follows the format firstname.lastname@company.com. Email signatures should follow the company template available on the intranet. Microsoft Teams is the platform for instant messaging, video meetings, and team collaboration. All employees should be logged into Teams during working hours. Teams is organized into channels by department and project teams. For video meetings, use the Teams meeting feature accessed through the calendar function in Outlook. For large meetings or webinars (over 100 participants), use the Webex platform, accessible through the company portal. The company intranet, Connect, serves as the central hub for company information, department sites, forms, policies, and announcements. Access it at connect.company.com using your network credentials. Department-specific documentation and file sharing should be managed through SharePoint, which is accessible through the intranet or directly at sharepoint.company.com. For document collaboration, use Microsoft Office 365 apps with real-time co-authoring features. Documents should be stored in SharePoint or OneDrive for Business, not on local drives. The company's social collaboration platform, Workplace by Facebook, is used for company-wide announcements, employee recognition, and informal communication. All employees are expected to check their email and Teams messages at least three times daily during business hours. Urgent communications should be sent via Teams or phone rather than email. For mass communications to large groups, contact the Internal Communications team at communications@company.com for approval and assistance. The company maintains a Clean Desk Policy requiring all sensitive documents to be secured when not in use and all digital files to be stored in approved secure locations. For technical issues with any communication tools, contact the IT Help Desk at extension 1234 or submit a ticket through the IT Service Portal. For training on effectively using these tools, access the Communication Tools Training modules in the Learning Management System.",
