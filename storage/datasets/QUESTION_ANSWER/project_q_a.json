    "context": "The New Customer Portal project technical specifications outline the following technology stack requirements: Frontend development will primarily use React.js (version 18 or higher) with TypeScript for type safety, along with Next.js for server-side rendering capabilities. The component library will be based on Material UI with custom theming. State management will implement Redux with middleware for asynchronous operations. Backend services will be developed in Python (version 3.11+) using the FastAPI framework for REST endpoints and GraphQL for complex data queries. Database interactions will use SQLAlchemy as the ORM with PostgreSQL as the primary data store. Caching will be implemented using Redis. For specific data processing needs, some microservices will be written in Go for performance-critical operations. Infrastructure will be deployed in AWS using Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes, and defined using Terraform for infrastructure as code. CI/CD pipelines will be implemented using GitHub Actions with automated testing requirements including Jest for frontend and pytest for backend components.",

Any stakeholder may initiate a change request by completing the Change Request Form available on the project SharePoint site. Each request must include: a detailed description of the proposed change, business justification, expected benefits, potential impacts on scope/schedule/budget, and the urgency level (Critical, High, Medium, or Low). Upon submission, the project manager will log the request in the Change Control Register and conduct an initial assessment within 3 business days. Technical feasibility will be evaluated by the technical lead, who will document the effort estimate and technical impacts. The financial analyst will determine budget implications and ROI impact. For changes with estimated effort under 16 hours and no budget impact, the project manager has authority to approve. All other changes require review by the Change Control Board (CCB), which meets weekly on Wednesdays at 10:00 AM. The CCB consists of the project sponsor, project manager, technical lead, business representative, and finance representative. Decisions by the CCB will be one of the following: Approved (implemented as requested), Conditionally Approved (implemented with modifications), Deferred (postponed to a future phase), or Rejected (will not be implemented). Once approved, changes will be incorporated into the project plan, communicated to all stakeholders, and tracked through implementation. Emergency changes requiring immediate attention can be fast-tracked with the approval of the project sponsor, but must still be documented and reviewed retrospectively by the CCB.",

    "query": "What is the escalation path for critical issues in the Supply Chain Optimization project?",
    "context": "The escalation path for critical issues in the Supply Chain Optimization project follows a tiered approach based on issue severity and resolution timeframes. Tier 1 issues should first be reported to the workstream lead responsible for the affected area, who has 4 business hours to resolve or escalate the issue. If unresolved, the issue escalates to Tier 2, where the project manager must be notified via both email and phone. The project manager has 8 business hours to resolve the issue or develop an action plan. For issues requiring additional attention, Tier 3 escalation involves the program director and affected department heads, who must convene an emergency meeting within 12 business hours of notification. Critical issues threatening project success or business operations trigger Tier 4 escalation to the executive steering committee, with the CIO and COO being notified immediately. A war room approach is implemented for Tier 4 issues, with daily status meetings until resolution. All issues must be logged in the project management system with severity, impact, ownership, and resolution steps clearly documented. SLA response times are measured in business hours except for Severity 1 issues (system down, data corruption, or security breach), which are measured in clock hours and require 24/7 response. The escalation coordinator role rotates weekly among the project leadership team, with the assigned coordinator responsible for monitoring issue resolution and ensuring proper escalation protocols are followed. A post-resolution review is mandatory for all Tier 3 and Tier 4 escalations to document lessons learned and prevent recurrence.",

Severity 1 issues require 24/7 response measured in clock hours rather than business hours.
