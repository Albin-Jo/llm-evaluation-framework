Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords cannot contain easily guessable information such as usernames, the company name, or common words. Employees must change their passwords every 90 days, and the system will prompt for changes automatically. The system prevents reuse of the previous 10 passwords. Passwords should never be shared with anyone, including IT staff, managers, or coworkers. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access and can be set up using the company's authentication app. Employees should use a different password for each company system and application. Password managers are provided and encouraged for storing complex passwords securely. If you suspect your password has been compromised, change it immediately and notify the IT Security team at security@company.com or call the Security Helpdesk at ext. 7890.",

Personal devices must have the latest operating system updates, current antivirus software, and be protected with a strong password or biometric authentication. Devices must automatically lock after 5 minutes of inactivity. Employees are prohibited from downloading company data to local storage on personal devices; all company documents should be accessed through approved cloud applications. Jailbroken or rooted devices are not permitted on the company network. The company reserves the right to monitor, access, or delete company data on personal devices without notice. IT support for personal devices is limited to connectivity issues and company applications. Employees are responsible for backing up personal data on their devices, as the company is not liable for personal data loss during security measures like remote wiping.

Personal email, consumer cloud storage services (like Dropbox or personal Google Drive), and USB drives are strictly prohibited for sharing company information. Files containing sensitive or confidential information must be encrypted before sharing, even when using the SFTP. The Encryption Tool is available on all company devices in the Security Tools folder. Password-protect sensitive documents using the company's Document Security tool, which enforces strong encryption. Passwords for encrypted files must be communicated separately from the file itself and never in the same email or message chain. Preferably, passwords should be communicated via phone or the company's secure messaging platform. All external file sharing must be logged in the File Sharing Register on the compliance portal, including recipient details, file descriptions, date, and business purpose. Documents shared externally should include appropriate confidentiality headers and footers, which can be applied using the Document Template tool. Files containing personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) require additional approval from the Privacy Office before sharing. Set appropriate access expiration dates when using the SFTP; the recommended maximum is 30 days. Files shared through the SFTP can be configured for read-only access to prevent unauthorized editing. After confirmation that the intended recipient has received and accessed the files, delete the shared files from the SFTP to minimize exposure. Contact the Information Security team at infosec@company.com for guidance on sharing particularly sensitive information or for partners without compatible security systems.",

Always verify the sender's email address before responding to requests for sensitive information or clicking on links, even if the email appears to come from a known contact. Enable multi-factor authentication for your email account through the IT Self-Service Portal. Be cautious with email attachments; only open attachments from trusted sources and scan suspicious attachments using the company's antivirus software before opening. Avoid clicking on links in emails from unknown senders; instead, hover over links to preview the URL and verify it's legitimate. If you receive an unexpected email with a link or attachment from a known contact, verify with the sender via phone or in person before opening. Use the 'Report Phishing' button in the email client to report suspicious emails to the IT Security team for investigation. Company confidential information should only be sent via email when necessary; use the secure file sharing system for sensitive documents when possible. When sending sensitive information via email, use the encryption feature by including [SECURE] in the subject line. Avoid using personal email accounts for company business under any circumstances. Be cautious about auto-forwarding company emails to personal accounts, as this is generally prohibited by policy. The company email system automatically scans all inbound and outbound emails for malware, but this is not foolproof, so remain vigilant. Periodically clean your mailbox by deleting unnecessary emails, especially those with large attachments, to comply with storage limits and retention policies. When out of the office, use the email client's automatic reply feature to notify senders of your absence, but avoid including specific details about your location or return date. Remember that all company email communications may be monitored and are subject to discovery in legal proceedings.",

All new employees must complete the initial Security Awareness Training course within 14 days of their start date as part of the onboarding process. This comprehensive training covers the company's security policies, common threats, and best practices for protecting company and customer data. Following the initial training, all employees must complete quarterly security refresher modules, which typically take 20-30 minutes each and focus on specific security topics relevant to current threats and seasonal risks. The schedule for quarterly training is: Q1 (January-March) focuses on phishing and social engineering; Q2 (April-June) covers secure remote work practices; Q3 (July-September) addresses physical security and clean desk policies; and Q4 (October-December) reviews data protection and privacy regulations. Additional role-specific security training is required for employees with access to sensitive data or systems; these specialized courses must be completed annually and are assigned based on job function. Managers receive reports on their team's training completion status and are responsible for ensuring compliance within their departments. The Learning Management System (LMS) sends automatic reminders before training deadlines. Failure to complete required security training by the deadline results in escalation to the employee's manager and potentially to HR for repeated non-compliance. In some cases, system access may be restricted until training is completed. Special security alerts and emergency training modules may be distributed outside the regular schedule in response to emerging threats; these are typically shorter but must be completed within 7 days of assignment.

The IT Security team reviews all software requests to evaluate security risks, license compliance, and compatibility with existing systems; this process typically takes 3-5 business days. Software with known security vulnerabilities or that duplicates functionality of existing company tools will generally not be approved. Once approved, software must be installed by IT staff or through the company's Software Center application; employees do not have administrative privileges to install software directly.

    "context": "The company classifies data into four levels, each with specific handling requirements to ensure appropriate protection. Public data is information that can be freely disclosed to the public, such as marketing materials, press releases, and published annual reports. This data requires no special handling or protection beyond normal business practices. Internal data is information intended for general internal use, including organizational charts, internal newsletters, and non-sensitive procedural documents. This data should be shared only with employees and authorized contractors, must not be posted publicly, and should be stored on company-approved systems. Confidential data includes sensitive business information that could cause harm if disclosed, such as product development plans, financial projections, employee performance evaluations, and customer lists. Confidential data must be encrypted when stored electronically and when transmitted outside the company network, should be shared only with individuals who have a business need to know, requires secure disposal (shredding for physical documents, secure digital wiping for electronic files), and must be stored in secured locations (locked cabinets for physical documents, access-controlled drives for electronic files). Restricted data is the most sensitive category, including personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), payment card information (PCI), and intellectual property. Restricted data requires the highest level of protection: encryption at rest and in transit is mandatory, access is limited to specifically authorized individuals and logged/monitored, two-factor authentication is required for access, data must be stored only on company-managed servers (never on local devices or external media), and sharing outside the company requires a Non-Disclosure Agreement and approval from the Data Governance team.
