    "query": "What is the process for requesting office supplies?",
    "context": "Office supplies can be requested through the company's procurement system, SupplyHub, which is accessible via the company intranet. Employees should log in using their company credentials and navigate to the 'Office Supplies' category. The system offers a catalog of approved items from contracted suppliers with negotiated pricing. For standard office supplies (pens, notepads, folders, etc.) under $100, no approval is required; employees can simply add items to their cart and submit the order. For office supply orders between $100 and $500, supervisor approval is required through the system's automated workflow. Orders exceeding $500 require both supervisor and department head approval. After submission, approved orders are processed by the Procurement team within 1-2 business days and typically delivered to the employee's designated office location within 3-5 business days. Rush delivery is available for urgent requests and can be indicated during the checkout process, but should be limited to genuine business necessities. Specialized items not found in the standard catalog can be requested using the 'Special Request' form, which requires a business justification and goes through an additional review process by the Procurement team. Personal items should never be purchased through the company procurement system. The company maintains supply cabinets with commonly used items in each department area; employees should check these cabinets before placing orders for basic supplies that may already be available.",

To initiate a software purchase request, employees must complete the Software Purchase Request Form available on the Procurement portal. The form requires detailed information including the software name, vendor, purpose, business justification, number of licenses needed, estimated cost, and requested implementation timeline. All software requests must be submitted at least 30 days before the intended implementation date to allow sufficient time for evaluation and processing. Once submitted, the request follows a multi-step approval workflow: First, the employee's direct manager reviews the business justification and confirms budget availability. Then, the IT department evaluates the software for security compliance, compatibility with existing systems, potential redundancy with current tools, and technical requirements. If the purchase exceeds $5,000 or requires a contract term longer than one year, it also requires executive approval from the department head. The Information Security team must approve any software that processes, stores, or transmits sensitive data. The Legal department reviews all software licensing agreements for terms and conditions. Finally, the Procurement department negotiates pricing and processes the purchase once all approvals are received. After approval, software must be registered in the company's Software Asset Management system by IT staff. Employees will be notified by email once the software has been approved, purchased, and is ready for installation. For software that requires an annual subscription or renewal, the renewal process must be initiated at least 60 days before expiration using the Software Renewal Request Form.",

All IT hardware, including computers, monitors, tablets, smartphones, printers, and peripherals, must be purchased through the company's approved procurement channels. The company maintains a catalog of standard equipment configurations for various job roles; these pre-approved options can be viewed in the IT Equipment Catalog on the Procurement portal. Employees should select equipment that matches their job requirements from these standard options. Requests for non-standard equipment require additional justification and approval from the employee's manager and the IT Director. Purchase requests are initiated through the IT Equipment Request Form on the Procurement portal, which requires details including the equipment type, specific model from the catalog, business justification, and cost center information. Equipment under $1,000 requires manager approval, $1,000-$5,000 requires director-level approval, and purchases over $5,000 must be approved by a Vice President. All IT purchases must be made through the company's contracted vendors to ensure warranty coverage, support, and negotiated pricing. Emergency equipment purchases may be expedited through the IT Help Desk for critical business needs. Employees may not purchase IT equipment directly and seek reimbursement unless exceptional circumstances exist and prior approval is obtained from both IT and Finance. All company-owned IT equipment is tracked in the asset management system and must be returned to IT when no longer needed or when an employee leaves the company. Disposal of outdated equipment is handled exclusively by the IT department to ensure data security and environmental compliance.

    "query": "What is the policy for hiring external consultants?",
    "context": "The process for engaging external consultants requires careful planning and multiple approvals to ensure compliance and value for money. Departments seeking to hire consultants must first verify that the required expertise is not available internally by checking with HR and relevant department heads. Once the need for external expertise is confirmed, the hiring manager must complete the Consultant Engagement Request Form, available on the Procurement portal, at least 30 days before the desired start date. This form requires detailed information including the project scope, deliverables, timeline, estimated hours, proposed budget, and specific skills required. For engagements under $50,000, approval is required from the department director and Procurement. Engagements between $50,000 and $100,000 require additional approval from the division Vice President. Any engagement exceeding $100,000 requires CFO approval. All consultant engagements must have a defined Statement of Work (SOW) that clearly outlines the project scope, deliverables, timelines, acceptance criteria, and payment terms. The Legal department must review all consulting agreements before they are finalized. The company generally requires competitive bids from at least three qualified vendors for engagements over $25,000, unless a specific consultant has unique qualifications that cannot be matched by others. In such cases, a Sole Source Justification Form must be completed and approved. Consultants must sign the company's Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement before beginning work. For consultants who will access company systems or facilities, a background check is required, coordinated through HR. Consultant performance must be evaluated upon project completion using the Consultant Evaluation Form to build a knowledge base for future engagements.

    "query": "How do I process invoices for payment?",
    "context": "Invoice processing follows a standardized workflow to ensure proper documentation, approval, and timely payment to vendors. All invoices should be directed to the Accounts Payable (AP) department either by email to invoices@company.com or via the supplier portal. Paper invoices received by departments should be scanned and forwarded to AP immediately. Upon receipt, invoices are entered into the financial system and matched to the corresponding purchase order (PO) if one exists. For PO-based invoices, a three-way match is performed between the PO, the goods receipt or service confirmation, and the invoice. If all three documents align, the invoice is processed for payment according to the payment terms. Any discrepancies in quantity, price, or other details must be resolved before payment is approved. Non-PO invoices require approval from the budget owner before processing; these should be routed to the appropriate approver through the AP workflow system. Approvers must verify that the goods or services were received, the charges are accurate, and the correct account codes are used for the expense. Invoices under $5,000 require one level of approval, while those over $5,000 require two levels of approval based on the company's Delegation of Authority matrix. All approvals must be documented in the financial system. Approved invoices are processed according to vendor payment terms, typically net 30 days unless otherwise negotiated. The company offers early payment discounts to vendors who accept payment within 10 days (typically 2% discount).

    "query": "What is the bid process for large purchases?",
    "context": "The competitive bid process is required for all purchases exceeding $25,000 and ensures fair vendor selection and best value. The process begins with the creation of a detailed Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ) document that clearly outlines the requirements, specifications, timeline, evaluation criteria, submission instructions, and contract terms. This document must be reviewed and approved by both the requesting department head and Procurement before release. For technical or specialized purchases, subject matter experts should be consulted during the RFP development. RFPs must be sent to a minimum of three qualified vendors to ensure competitive pricing and solutions. In cases where fewer than three vendors are available, a Competitive Source Justification form must be completed explaining the limited vendor pool. All potential vendors must receive identical information to ensure a level playing field. Questions from vendors must be answered in writing and shared with all bidders to maintain transparency. Vendors typically have 2-4 weeks to respond, depending on the complexity of the request. Bid responses are evaluated by a cross-functional team including representatives from the requesting department, Procurement, and subject matter experts if needed. Evaluation criteria must be established before receiving bids and should include factors such as technical capability, experience, financial stability, pricing, and adherence to requirements. Each criterion should be weighted based on importance to the overall decision. Following the evaluation, the team recommends a vendor selection, documented in the Vendor Selection Form with detailed justification. Purchases between $25,000 and $100,000 require director-level approval of the vendor selection, while purchases exceeding $100,000 require VP or executive approval depending on the amount. After approval, Procurement negotiates final terms and prepares the contract for legal review. The entire bid process typically takes 6-12 weeks, so departments should plan accordingly. Exceptions to the bid process may be granted in limited circumstances, such as emergency situations or when a vendor has unique capabilities, but require a Bid Waiver Form approved by the CFO.",

This form requires detailed information including the asset description, business justification, cost estimates, expected useful life, depreciation schedule, and financial impact analysis. For IT-related capital expenditures, the IT department must provide additional technical specifications and integration requirements. The approval process follows a tiered structure based on the expenditure amount: $5,000-$25,000 requires Director and Finance Manager approval; $25,001-$100,000 requires VP and Controller approval; $100,001-$500,000 requires SVP and CFO approval; and amounts exceeding $500,000 require CEO and Board approval for non-budgeted items.

The process begins when a department identifies a need that cannot be met by existing vendors. The requesting department must first submit a New Vendor Request Form through the Procurement portal, providing the vendor's name, contact information, services or products offered, and business justification for adding the vendor. Procurement performs an initial screening to verify the business need and confirm that no existing vendors can provide the required goods or services. If approved to proceed, the potential vendor must complete the Vendor Registration Package, which includes the W-9 or W-8 form (for international vendors), banking information for payments, certificates of insurance, diversity certification (if applicable), and acknowledgment of the Supplier Code of Conduct. Simultaneously, Procurement conducts vendor due diligence, including financial stability assessment, reference checks, compliance with regulations, and potential conflicts of interest. For vendors that will handle sensitive data or require system access, the Information Security team performs a security assessment. Vendors handling protected information must complete a security questionnaire and may undergo more thorough security audits depending on the data sensitivity. Risk Management reviews insurance requirements based on the goods or services provided and ensures the vendor's coverage meets company standards. Legal department review is required for all vendor contracts and agreements. The company uses standard contract templates whenever possible, though vendors may propose their own contracts subject to legal review and negotiation. Key contract terms, including pricing, payment terms, service levels, warranties, and termination clauses, are negotiated by Procurement with input from the requesting department.
