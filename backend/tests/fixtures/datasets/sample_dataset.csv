What is a large language model?,A large language model (LLM) is a type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like text.,Large language models are AI systems trained on massive text datasets that can generate human-like text responses.
How do you evaluate LLMs?,LLMs can be evaluated using metrics like BLEU score ROUGE and human evaluation.,LLMs are evaluated through a combination of automated metrics (BLEU ROUGE) and human evaluation for factors like accuracy coherence and relevance.
What is RAGAS?,RAGAS is an evaluation framework for retrieval augmented generation systems.,RAGAS is an open-source framework for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation systems using metrics like faithfulness answer relevance and context relevance.
How can I use DeepEval for testing?,DeepEval provides tools for testing LLM applications with evaluation metrics.,DeepEval is a framework that allows you to create test cases for LLM applications using metrics like factual consistency and semantic similarity.
What is a prompt template?,A prompt template is a reusable structure for creating consistent prompts with variable placeholders.,A prompt template is a standardized format for creating prompts with placeholders for variables that get filled at runtime.
Why is dataset quality important for LLM evaluation?,High-quality datasets ensure reliable and meaningful evaluation results.,Dataset quality is crucial for LLM evaluation because it directly impacts the reliability and validity of the assessment results.
What is OPIK?,OPIK is an evaluation framework developed for assessing knowledge-intensive tasks in LLMs.,OPIK (Objective and Principled Knowledge Evaluation) is a framework for evaluating LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks using principles of objectivity and fairness.
How do you handle hallucinations in LLM evaluation?,Hallucinations can be detected using factual consistency checks and knowledge verification.,Hallucinations are evaluated through factual consistency metrics reference verification and comparison with known ground truths.
What makes a good test dataset?,A good test dataset should be diverse representative and challenging.,Good test datasets should be diverse representative of real-world scenarios balanced and contain challenging examples that test the limits of the system.
How can I compare different LLM versions?,Version comparison requires consistent datasets metrics and evaluation methodology.,To compare LLM versions you should use the same datasets evaluation metrics testing methodology and if possible perform statistical significance testing on the results.
