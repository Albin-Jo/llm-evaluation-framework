# LLM Evaluation Framework: Session Context

## Project Overview
The LLM Evaluation Framework is an internal tool for evaluating domain-specific AI agents built with Azure OpenAI. The system allows users to create evaluations, manage datasets, compare agent performance, and generate reports.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Current Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Implement agents Module
- **Last Session Date**: One day ago
- **Last Session Focus**: We have Implemented dataset, prompt Module and evaluation module
- **Current Focus**: Analyse, debug current implementation and improve the agents module. Make sure its following best practices and fullfillis requirement

## Today's Session Goal
In this session, we'll focus on: Analyse, debug, improve current implementation of Agents module
Focus on all apis, services, models, and repository layer of agents module.
Testing agent using azure open ai

## Key Considerations
- Include a detailed explanation of the implementation and usage
- Create sample evaluation and test cases so that we can test the apis
- Unit testing should be implemented for critical components
- always make sure to include file name and path reference
