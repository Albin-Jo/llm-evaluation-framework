# LLM Evaluation Framework: Session Context

## Project Overview
The LLM Evaluation Framework is an internal tool for evaluating domain-specific AI agents built with Azure OpenAI. The system allows users to create evaluations, manage datasets, compare agent performance, and generate reports.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Current Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Debug ragas evaluation 
- **Last Session Date**: One day ago
- **Last Session Focus**: We have Implemented dataset, prompt Module, evaluation module and agent module
- **Current Focus**: we are getting error while starting an evaluation

## Components Status

| Component | Status      | Notes                                              |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Project Structure | Complete    | Basic FastAPI and Angular dashboard setup finished |
| Authentication | Hold        | OIDC integration 80% complete                      |
| Dataset Management | Complete    | All CRUD operations implemented                    |
| Agent Integration |  Started |                          |
| Evaluation Engine | Completed   |                                                    |
| Reports Module | Not Started |                              |
| Frontend Dashboard | Started     | Basic layout complete, components in development   |

## Today's Session Goal
Evaluation apis are working.We can create evaluations. But when evaluations start we are getting erros.
Apis are working as expected. evaluation status will be updated failed. 
You need to resolve this issue

## Key Considerations
- Include a detailed explanation of the implementation and usage
- Create sample evaluation and test cases so that we can test the apis
- Unit testing should be implemented for critical components
- always make sure to include file name and path reference
