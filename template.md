# LLM Evaluation Framework: Session Context

## Project Overview
The LLM Evaluation Framework is an internal tool for evaluating domain-specific AI agents built with Azure OpenAI. The system allows users to create evaluations, manage datasets, compare agent performance, and generate reports.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Current Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Analyse and Debug
- **Last Session Date**: NA
- **Last Session Focus**: Created project structure and created folders basic setup
- **Current Focus**: Analyse and debug the setup.

## Components Status

| Component | Status      | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Project Structure | Complete    | Basic FastAPI and React setup finished |
| Authentication | In Progress | OIDC integration 80% complete |
| Dataset Management | Complete    | All CRUD operations implemented |
| Agent Integration | Not Started | Scheduled for Phase 2 |
| Evaluation Engine | Not Started | Basic structure created, metrics integration pending |
| Reports Module | Not Started | Scheduled for Phase 3 |
| Frontend Dashboard | In Progress | Basic layout complete, components in development |

## Today's Session Goal
In this session, we'll focus on: Analyse the project setup and api end points. Focus on dataset apis, services and repositories

## Key Considerations
- Integration with existing Azure OpenAI agents is a priority
- Email validation is required for report recipients
- Unit testing should be implemented for critical components
- Focus on getting a working system first, with advanced features planned for later phases
